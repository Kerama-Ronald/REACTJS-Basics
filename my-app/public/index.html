      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

        <h1>1986 Chernobyl Disaster</h1>
        <p>The Chernobyl disaster was a nuclear accident that occurred on 26 April 1986 at the No. 4 reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, then located in the Ukrainian SSR of the Soviet Union. It is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history and is one of only two nuclear energy accidents rated at seven—the maximum severity—on the International Nuclear Event Scale, the other being the Fukushima disaster in 2011. The disaster released a radioactive cloud that spread over much of Western USSR and Europe, causing long-term environmental and health effects.</p>
